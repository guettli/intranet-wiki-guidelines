# Intranet Wiki Guidelines

I maintain Intranet Wikis for fun and provit. I like:

* [Single Source of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth)
* [Canonicalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization)
* [Hyperlinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink)

# What is an Intranet Wiki?

* An Intranet Wiki is a tool is a knowledge base on which users collaboratively edit content.
* This content is available for all employees in a company and not visible on the world wide web.
* One term is explained on one page. This page is accessible via [a canonical URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization#URL).

Every company has its terminology. For new employees, it is very helpful to have a definition of the terms which
are custom.

But a central Wiki is useful to improve the communication between departments. Because the terminology between departments differs.

# Difference between an Intranet Wiki and Wikipedia

Wikipedia pages are often very detailed. Usually, it makes no sense to explain every detail in an Intranet Wiki.

An Intranet Wiki should provide an overview. Historical details should be removed to focus on the current state.

# #contact-channel

It is feasible to publish a #contact-channel on every wiki page. If a reader of the page has a question that is not answered on this page, he should know where he can ask his questions.

This could be a chat-channel, an email address or a role. It is feasible to avoid particular people, since they can be on holiday, busy or [hit by bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).

# Default permissions

The default should be: Everybody can create/update/delete pages. Only a few pages should be restricted.

# Avoid Spaces

Most Wiki systems allow you to create several spaces. This sounds feasible in the beginning. 
This way department D1 can create
pages in space-D1 and department D2 can create pages in space-D2 and there will be peace since these spaces don't overlap.

No, please avoid spaces. Sooner or later Term "X" will get explained twice. Once space-D1 and once space-D2. Now an employee of department D3 wants to learn about "X". What should he do?

This "peace" you get with spaces, will get [information silos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo).

Next argument against spaces: Imagine you are new at the company and you realize that there is no page up to now for "foo".

You want to add value to the wiki and you want to create a page about "foo". Now you are faced with the question "Which space should I use?". Likely, the new and motivated employee can't get an answer to this question soon. Then it is Friday evening, then the weekend, and on Monday there are so many different things, that he will forget to create a page for "foo".

Without spaces, it is easier to create new pages.

# Dealing with outdated pages

Ask on the #contact-channel.
